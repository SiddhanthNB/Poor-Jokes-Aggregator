A simple Python project which is a Jokes Aggregator using website API.
Code takes an input keyword, fetches a joke around that keyword through a Website API, and displays it if found.
website used: [a link](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/)
p.s. Also played around with display fonts within the python code.
