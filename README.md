A simple Python project which is a Jokes Aggregator using website API.

Code takes an input keyword, fetches a joke around that keyword through a Website API, and displays it if found.

Website used: [icanhazdadjoke.com](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search)

p.s. Also played around with display fonts within the python code.
